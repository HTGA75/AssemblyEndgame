## About Assembly Endgame
Assembly Endgame is a fun and interactive word-guessing game built as the capstone project for the Scrimba React 19 Course. The objective is simple: guess the word by pressing the on-screen keys.

But thereâ€™s a twist!
Every wrong guess eliminates a programming language from existence. If you lose, only Assembly Language remains, marking the "endgame" for all other languages.

### Key Features
Interactive Gameplay: Guess the word by selecting letters from a virtual keyboard.
Progressive Elimination: Watch popular programming languages disappear with every incorrect guess.
Dynamic UI: React-powered interface for a seamless and responsive gaming experience.
Victory or Assembly: Win by guessing the word correctly or lose and witness the rise of Assembly as the last surviving language.
Technologies Used
React 19: Build and manage UI components.
JavaScript (ES6): Game logic and interactivity.
CSS Modules: Responsive and modular styling.
Play, learn, and experience the dramatic showdown of programming languages in Assembly Endgame! Contributions and feedback are welcome.
